jQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

I created a calculator that can be used to keep track of employees salaries and calculate the total monthly costs for the employer. The calculator  takes in user input in the forms of first and last name, employee identification, job title, and annual salary. It then logs all the information into a table and keeps track of the total monthly costs of the employees salaries who were added. If an employee was added by mistake or is needed to be removed for any reason, there is a delete button built into the employee row that can remove that employee from the table.
